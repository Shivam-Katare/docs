title: Multiple property paths
slug: /custom-rules/multiple-property-paths

Sometimes, a property (key/value) that you want to test against will be located in multiple places. For example, if you want to create a custom rule that ensures all container images have a pinned version, you can avoid creating a rule logic that declares all possible paths because checking the value of the image property in two locations can be complex.&#x20;

- When _kind is Deployment_, the value of the property `spec.template.spec.containers[].image` _should have_ a pinned version

- When _kind is Pod_, the value of the property `spec.containers[].image` _should have_ a pinned version

To avoid this complexity, you can write a JSON Schema with a rule logic that will define the common path and disregard all prefixes:&#x20;

- The value of the property `**.spec.containers[].image`_ should have_ a [pinned version](https://regex101.com/r/su2NXg/1)&#x20;

Here is an example of what that would look like:

```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_CONTAINERS_MISSING_IMAGE_VALUE_VERSION
    name: Ensure each container image has a pinned (tag) version [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: |
      Not setting image version for your containers is like going to the casino üé∞ - you don't know which version you'll get
    schema:
      definitions:
        imagePattern:
          properties:
            spec:
              properties:
                containers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    properties:
                      image:
                        type: string
                        pattern: ^(?=.*[:|@](?=.+)(?!latest)).*$
      allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/imagePattern'
      additionalProperties:
        $ref: '#'
      items:
        $ref: '#'
```

The above rule is enforcing the same logic as our built-in rule - [‚òëÔ∏è Ensure each container image has a pinned (tag) version](docId:nhvnGLR0KXYQR2mq1jkrH)
