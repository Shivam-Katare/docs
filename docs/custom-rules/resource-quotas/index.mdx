## Overview

We extended JSON Schema with the keywords `resourceMinimum` and `resourceMaximum` to help create custom rules for comparing resource quotas strings (CPU and memory) like 1000m and 1G. Here's an example check for when memory and CPU fall within a certain range.

Let's say we want to make sure that Kubernetes configs always have a CPU limit within the range of 250m-500m. This is how the custom rule to check that would look:

```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_CPU_LIMIT_VALUE
    name: Ensure each container has a configured CPU limit within range [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: CPU limit value should be within the accepted boundaries (250m-500m)
    schema:
      properties:
        spec:
          properties:
            containers:
              items:
                properties:
                  resources:
                    properties:
                      limits:
                        properties:
                          cpu:
                            resourceMinimum: 250m
                            resourceMaximum: 500m
```

And this is how the policy would look:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
policies:
  - name: Default
    isDefault: true
    rules:
      - identifier: CUSTOM_CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_CPU_LIMIT_VALUE
        messageOnFailure: CPU limit value should be within the accepted boundaries (250m-500m)
#   - name: staging
#     rules:
#       - identifier: CUSTOM_CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_CPU_LIMIT_VALUE
#         messageOnFailure: This message will override the rule's `defaultMessageOnFailure` property

customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_CPU_LIMIT_VALUE
    name: Ensure each container has a configured CPU limit within range [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: CPU limit value should be within the accepted boundaries (250m-600m)
    schema:
      properties:
        spec:
          properties:
            containers:
              items:
                properties:
                  resources:
                    properties:
                      limits:
                        properties:
                          cpu:
                            resourceMinimum: 250m
                            resourceMaximum: 500m
```

## See it in action

Let's test this manifest after publishing the policy.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cpu-demo
      image: images.my-company.example/app:v4
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: '64Mi'
          cpu: '250m'
        limits:
          memory: '128Mi'
          cpu: '1G'
```

This manifest will fail because it has a container (cpu-demo) with a CPU limit larger than 500m:

## Important notes

- `resourceMinimum` and `resourceMaximum` keywords will translate and compare input from different resource quotas, so if CPU will be "0.6", the rule will still fail (600m=0.6).

- The rule in this example **will not fail** if the property path `resources.limits.cpu` **doesn't exist**. If you want the policy check to fail in a case like that, you need to either add our [built-in rule](https://hub.datree.io/ensure-cpu-limit) to this policy or add it to the rule logic by using \`[required](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.5.3)\`.

- The above rule won't work if the property containers is nested under `spec.template.spec.containers[]`. If you want the rule to support the property path `**.spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu`, find direction for its implementation [here](https://hub.datree.io/multiple-property-paths).
