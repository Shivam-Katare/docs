## Tokens mismatch

<img src='/img/troubleshooting/1.avif' alt='' />

If you see this message in your dashboard, it means that we identified there are two [account tokens](/setup/account-token) associate with your account - one in your CLI and a different one in your dashboard. This can be an issue because it will break the connection between the policy checks that are executed (CLI) and the centralized policy (dashboard). As a result, you will not be able to control your policies or see results on your history page.

### How to fix tokens mismatch?

You will need to set your CLI token to match your dashboard token:

1.  [Get your dashboard account token](/setup/account-token#wd-from-the-centralized-policy-dashboard)

2.  [Set your dashboard account token in your CLI](/setup/account-token#o1-overriding-account-token)

## Running Datree on Alpine (Linux) image

Alpine is missing some dependencies that [are required](https://github.com/datreeio/helm-datree/issues/22) to successfully install Datree.

### How to fix missing dependencies?

Adding the following command to the CI should fix this:Â `apk add curl bash`
This will add curl and bash commands which our install scripts require in order to run.
