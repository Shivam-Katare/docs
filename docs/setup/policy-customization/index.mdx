## Rule Skipping

Rule skipping allows you to instrument your policy evaluation process, and specify which of your rules should not apply to a specific resource. 

:::info
Skipping is allowed for a specific resource instance, skipping rules on a specific namespace or container is currently not supported.
:::

Skipping is done by adding the following annotation to a given resource manifest:  
> datree.io/skip/**[PAC_identifier]**: **[skip message]**

**PAC_identifier** - the unique rule identifier.  
**Skip message** - optional text to be presented in the policy check output (CLI and history tab at the dashboard).  <br/><br/>

To obtain identifiers of *built-in rules*, go to your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/cli/policies/) and click on the 'i' icon of your desired rule:  
<img src="/img/setup/policy-customization/1.png" width="50%" /> <br/><br/>

This will lead you to the documentation of the rule, where you will find the identifier:
<img src="/img/setup/policy-customization/2.png" width="80%" /> <br/><br/>

Identifiers of *custom rules* can be found in the policy.yaml file, when in Policy-as-code mode.  For example:  
```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels ('prod', 'staging' and 'test')
    schema:
```

### Example YAML with skipped rules:  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rss-site
  namespace: test
  labels:
    environment: prod
    app: web
  annotations:
    datree.io/skip/WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE: irrelevant for deployments, skipping.
    datree.io/skip/CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY: irrelevant for prod environment, skipping.
```
