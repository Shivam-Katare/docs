## Rule skipping

Rule skipping allows you to instrument your policy evaluation process, and specify which of your rules should not apply to a specific resource. 

:::info
Skipping is allowed for a specific resource instance, skipping rules on a specific namespace or container is currently not supported.
:::

Skipping is done by adding the following [annotation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) to a given K8s manifest:
```yaml
datree.io/skip/[identifier]: [skip_message]
```
**identifier** - the unique rule identifier.  
**skip_message** - optional text to be presented in the policy check output (CLI and history tab at the dashboard).  <br/><br/>

Identifiers of *built-in rules* are available in the dashboard, in the policy page:  
<img src='/img/setup/policy-customization/1.png' width='90%' /><br/><br/>

Identifiers of *custom rules* can be found in the policy.yaml file, when in Policy-as-code mode.  For example:  
```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels ('prod', 'staging' and 'test')
    schema:
```

### [EXAMPLE] K8s manifest with skipped rule:  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rss-site
  namespace: test
  labels:
    environment: prod
    app: web
  annotations:
    datree.io/skip/CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY: irrelevant for prod environment, skipping.
```
