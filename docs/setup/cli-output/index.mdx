## Evaluated files

> File:** %fileName% **- scanned file full (path) name

## Check body

Every Kubernetes manifest that is scanned by Datree is also validated before the policy check is preform. If the manifest is not valid, the policy check will not be calculated.&#x20;

### \[ ] YAML validation

This step verifies that the file is a valid YAML file

### \[ ] Kubernetes schema validation

This step verifies that the file is a valid Kubernetes file

### \[ ] Policy check

This step verifies that the file is following your Kubernetes policy

**A. Rule name** - rules can be disabled from the centralized policy dashboard

**B. Number of occurrences** - how many times the rule failed on this specific file

**C. Detailed failure occurrences** - which configuration within your file prompted the failure

**D. Message on fail** - text can be changed from the centralized policy dashboard

## Check summary

A summary of all the validations and policy checks that ran on this execution. &#x20;

### Files status

- **Passing YAML validation** - the total number of valid YAML files

- **Passing Kubernetes (%schemaVersion%) schema validation** - the total number of valid Kubernetes files

- **Passing policy check** - the total number of files that are passing all the rules in your policy

### Policy table

- **Enabled rules in policy “default”** - number of rules enabled on this [policy](/faq#what-is-a-policy)

- **Configs tested against policy** - number of configurations scanned (one YAML file can contain several Kubernetes configurations)

- **Total rules evaluated** - number of rules in policy X number of configs tested

- **Total rules failed** - number of rules failed from the total of rules evaluated

- **Total rules passed** - number of rules passed from the total of rules evaluated

- **See all rules in policy** - link to your account [Centralized policy](/setup/centralized-policy) dashboard

## Exit codes

If one of the validations (YAML and Kubernetes schema) OR the policy check fails - the CLI will return **exit code 2**  
If the CLI ran into any errors, or was used incorrectly (i.e. passing an unknown argument) - the CLI will return **exit code 1**  
If all validations and the policy check passed - the CLI will return **exit code 0**.
