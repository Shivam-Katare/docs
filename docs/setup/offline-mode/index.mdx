## Air-gapped environment support
It is possible to run Datree as a standalone in an air-gapped environment  
by downloading [Datree’s binary](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/releases/latest) manually and copying it to your offline environment.

When setting Datree to work without an internet connection, you will lose the following functionality:
* Centralized policy registry
* Seamless integration to the Kubernetes schema verification step
* Access to the dashboard and all of his components (e.g. history page, token management, etc.)

### How to customize your policy 
By design, Datree’s binary is compiled together with the [built-in policies](https://hub.datree.io/built-in-rules#containers) and their pre-configured (enabled) rules.  
When running `datree test`, you will test your manifests against the "Default" policy.

To overwrite the default policy setup, you will need to pass datree your own [policy-as-code](https://hub.datree.io/setup/policy-as-code#policiesyaml) (YAML) configuration file path with the `--policy-config` flag:
```
E.g: datree test k8s-demo.yaml --policy-config policies.yaml
```

### How to enable Kubernetes schema verification step locally
When there is an internet connection, datree knows how to fetch the relevant Kubernetes schema from GitHub. 

Therefore, to enable this check in the offline mode, first, you will need to copy the relevant [schema version dir](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) (e.g. `v1.21.0-standalone-strict/`) to your air-gapped environment.

Then pass the dir location to datree with the `--schema-location` flag:
```terminal
datree test [manifest] --schema-location '[schemaVersionDir]/{{ .ResourceKind }}{{ .KindSuffix }}.json'
```
```
E.g: datree test k8s-demo.yaml --schema-location 'v1.21.0-standalone-strict/{{ .ResourceKind }}{{ .KindSuffix }}.json'
```
