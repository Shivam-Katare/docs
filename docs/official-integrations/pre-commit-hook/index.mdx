[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of the hooks.

```yaml
# sample .pre-commit-config.yaml for a project that would like to use datree with pre-commit
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/datreeio/datree
    # rev is the .pre-commit-hooks.yaml version
    # could also be a version or a release tag
    rev: HEAD
    hooks:
      - id: datree-docker
```
