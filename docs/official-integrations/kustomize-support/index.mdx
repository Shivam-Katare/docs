### Overview

Datree comes with out-of-the-box support for Kustomize, allowing you to easily scan your Kustomization file and the resources it will generate for misconfigurations.

When testing a kustomization directory, Datree will build temporary copies of the resources defined in kustomization.yaml and run a policy check against them.

**Linux**, **MacOS**, and **Windows** are supported.

### Dependencies

Using the Datree CLI to scan kustomize files requires [**Kustomize**](https://kustomize.io/) and/or [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to be installed.

### Usage

Simply add the 'kustomize' argument to the CLI command, like so:

> datree kustomize test [path] [cliArgs] -- [kustomizeArgs]

**path **-\** **the path to your desired kustomize directory (that contains a kustomization.yaml file).**
cliArgs \*\*(*optional*) - your desired Datree CLI arguments, as described here: [CLI arguments](/setup/cli-arguments)&#x20;
**kustomizeArgs** (*optional\*) - your desired arguments for the 'kustomize build' command. To see a list of supported arguments, run `kustomize build -h` or `kubectl kustomize -h`

### Examples

Assuming "/path/to/dir/" is a directory containing a 'kustomization.yaml' file, the following command will perform a policy check against all generated resources:

> datree kustomize test /path/to/dir/

The following command will also perform a policy check against all generated resources, this time using k8s schema version 1.23.0 and a Datree policy named "staging":

> datree kustomize test /path/to/dir/ -s 1.23.0 -p staging
